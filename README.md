# PHP Micro‑Framework From Scratch
This is a pet project of mine, to build a lightweight MVC‑style framework with nothing more than PHP’s standard library. Every component—from autoloading to the service container—has been implemented manually as an exercise in building the mechanics normally provided out-of-the-box by frameworks and libraries.

## Current features 

## Todo
- handle auth
- having a request validator would be nice
- imlement rate limiting
- handle migrations
- I'm not sure that I ever want to go through the process of creating an ORM, but I should make it easy to install and use one
- turn this into a library so that it is easy to use in projects
